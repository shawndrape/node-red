1. Download the node-red code from the appropriate github repository.
2. Launch the program on your local computer so that the server portion is started.
3. Use a web browser to connect to the server and open the front end.
4. Play with a few building blocks by placing them on the canvas, connecting their inputs to outputs, and deploying them.
5. Study the source code, which is written in javascript.
6. Modify the source code such that when the user hits the deploy button in his browser, a list of all his configured building blocks is written out to the console as well as their connections.
7. Send your full source code back to me and let me know which files you modified. I will test your code to see if it performs the correct function.
